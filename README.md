# Iris-Authentication-System

This is a project done during my third year at Sup'com. The purpose of this work is to detect the Iris of a person standing in front of a door using a Raspberry Pi and an NIR camera. 

This code performs the segmentation of the Iris and outputs the label of the user requesting the authentication using a Machine learning trained model. 

A system admin should enrol users manually in the Raspeberry PI.
Multispectral Biometrics by David Zhang, Yazhuo Gong, Zhenhua Guo and Opencv Blueprints Joseph Howse were helpful guides to accomplish this work.
